Erin Neitzel is a filmmaker and artist from Colorado, working in New York City. Her practice straddles the analog and the digital, and her work concerns the way the body is strung between these two worlds, the analog and the digital, both surplanted atop each other and inexorably intertwined. Themes of bodily and spiritual dysmorphia are reoccurring, as well as modern paranoias, feminine presentations, and domestic insecurity. 
At the University of Colorado where she obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in film production, she began collaborating with artists of many forms, including dance, music, and poetry. It was also then that analog mediums entered her work, shooting on 16mm film and learning to project 35mm films. Now she uses a mixture of film, digital, and DV tape, to capture the texture of different environments and experiences.

Erin was the 3-time recipient of the Virgil Grillo Award in Filmmaking at the University of Colorado, and her narrative and and experimental works have been screened at indie festivals around the world. She is always interested in seeking new collaborators.
